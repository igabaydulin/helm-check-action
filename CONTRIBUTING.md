### How to Contribute

#### Discuss

If you suspect an issue, perform a search in the
[GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/igabaydulin/helm-check-action/issues), using a few different keywords.
When you find related issues and discussions, prior or current, it helps you to learn and
it helps us to make a decision.

#### Submit a Pull Request

You can contribute a source code change by submitting a pull request.

1. Always check out the `master` branch and submit pull requests against it

1. Use short branch names, preferably based on the GitHub issue (e.g. `22276`), or
otherwise using succinct, lower-case, dash (-) delimited names, such as `fix-warnings`.

1. Choose the granularity of your commits consciously and squash commits that represent
multiple edits or corrections of the same logical change. See
[Rewriting History section of Pro Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History)
for an overview of streamlining commit history.

1. Format commit messages using 55 characters for the subject line, 72 lines for the
description, followed by the issue fixed, e.g. `Fixes #22276`.
See the
[Commit Guidelines section of Pro Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Distributed-Git-Contributing-to-a-Project#Commit-Guidelines)
for best practices around commit messages and use `git log` to see some examples.

1. List the GitHub issue number in the PR description.

If accepted, your contribution may be heavily modified as needed prior to merging.
You will likely retain author attribution for your Git commits granted that the bulk of
your changes remain intact. You may also be asked to rework the submission.

If asked to make corrections, simply push the changes against the same branch, and your
pull request will be updated. In other words, you do not need to create a new pull request
when asked to make changes.
